148 Pseudo- Tertulliani [cir. 1.

Apostolorum condignam meruit ab apostolo Petro iustamque
sententiam. Hie ausus est summam se dicere Virtutem,
id est, summum Deum3 mundum autem ab angelis suis
institutum3 ad daemonem se errantem, qui esset Sapientia,
5descendisse quaerendum3 apud Iudaeos se in phantasmate
Dei non passum, sed esse quasi passum.
Post hune Menander discipulus ipsius, simiIIter ma·

dixerat, hoe se Menander esse dicebat, negans habere

(Apol. i. 16, 56, Dial. rao; Euseb. ii. 13), and he is followed by
Irenaeus i. 16 ; Hippoi. Philosoph. vi. 7, 18, 193 Tertull. de anun. 343
Epiphan. Haer. 313 Philast. 293 Theodor. Haer. sab. i. 1. Simon
apparently adopted a current Gnostie terminology and teaohing, hut
added the doctrine of the transmigration of souis in order to enable
him to identify himself with the Supreme Power and his oompanion
Helena with the female principle. His followers were guilty of the
¹ grossest immoralities. His Christology, like that of all the Gnostics,
was Doeetio. He taught that he himself had appeared as Jesus
amongst the Jews. Ι
in Astis Apostolorum. Acts viii. 20 f.

3. mundum ab angelis institutum. This was a common tenet
of all the Gnostie teaehers.

4 ad daemonem se errantem. Oehler‘s comestion. a daemone ae
errante Lean, Heraens: a daemone se oberrante Gany„ aar, Pam,
aas ae daemone se oberrante Rhea: ad oves aberrantes se aaa.
conju ad Ennoiam se ovem errantem Heroid: ad daemonem seeum
errantem Jun. The ‘daemon' or ‘lost sheep' was Helen, Simon's
first Ennoia, whom he had purchased at Tyre3 Iren. i. 16.

sapientia = Σοφία of the common Gnostie myths, here identified
with the fallen Helen, to effect whose deliveranee Simon had appeared.

7. Menander. A Samaritan teaoher in Antioeh and a pupil of
Simon, our knowledge of whom is derived from J nstin Martyr Apol.
i. 26, 56, and Irenaeus i. 17: comp. Euseb. iii. 26 ; Ter-tull. de anim.
' 23, 503 de res. earn. 5. The Menandrianists are named in the list
of Hegesippus3 Euaeb. iv. aa.

8. aeque. Leia: ipse reliqui.

quioquid se Simon dixerat. Aeeording to Irenaeus, whose
ultimate authority was no doubt J nstin Martyr, Menander did not
identify himself, as Simon did, with the Supremo Power, Whom he
deolared to be unknown to all, but asserted that he himself was
sent aa a Savium ior mankind; Iren l. e.
