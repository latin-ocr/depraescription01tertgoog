diem divini iudicii. libi quoque optamus admonitionem

CAPUT IV.

Nori te terremus, qui neo timemus ; sed velim, ut omnes
salvos facere possimus, monendo μὴ θεομαχεῖν. Potes et officio
iurisdictionis tuae fungi et burnanitatis meminisse, vel quia
et vos sub gladio estis. Quid enim amplius tibi mandatorio

siege it finally surrendered in 196 to Severus, who inflicted upon its
inhabitante a terrible vengeance; Dion Cass. lxxiv, 10; Herodian. iii. 6.

christiani gaudete! ‘Gaudetel' was the congratulator-y
formula indicative of exultation or victory. Rigalt quotes the inscrip-
tion on a gold eoin commemorating a victory of Maximian Gaurana
Bonam. Gomp. Prudent. Cati. xii. 201 ; Martial xi. 61.

3. Adrumeticum Mavilum. Nothing more is known of this
martyr. He is commemorated on Jan.4 in the Bollandis Acts.
Adrumetum (modern Susa), a city on the coast 100 miles south of
Karthago, was the capital of the African province of Byzacium. Caes.
B. G. ii. 23; Liv. xxx. 29; Plin. H. N. v. 4. 3.

ad bestias damnasses. This was contrary to law, see below
ch. 4. The nobly-born Perpetua was thus illegally condemned.

4. et statim haec vexatio, iac. This sentence is very obscure:
toea eeealio may be (1) identical with interpellatio sanquinia, and then
will probably refer to an attaok of illnees which had seized the proconsul,
and was now again repeated as a warnin33 interpellatio on this view
simply=monitus Or (2) on the other hand they may be distinguished,
naratio referring to the destructive raim mentioned above, and interp,
aanq. to a new outbreak of pestilerae.

5. interpellatio. The ‘ interruption,' in the form oi some personal
or public calamity, which put a stop tc the governor's persecuting policy.
In tbe Oxford translation, however, tho phrase has been interpreted quite
differently oi the blood of the Christian martyre appealing for justioe;
interpellatio being in legal terminology an ‘appeal to the court’:
Digest. v. 1. 23, l. 16. 1.
