facta of history, the truth of which, in the first instance, eye-
witnesses alone could substantiata. Chriat’s Deatlv aad
Resurrection were events which had taken place at a definite
tima in the world's history. How, then, amid the natural
tendeneies of human thought and belief to disintegration and
change, was the unimpaired tradition of the fundamental
facts of Our Lord's life, or cardinal doctrines of the faith-

How was the unity of belief, which is of the essence of the
Ohurch's life, to be preserved? Here again we find exactly
the same kind of warrant supplied as at the first, namely‚
a continuone living voice of personal witness, For the
paramount obligation which the Apostles felt to be laid upon
them, as the periodos their own witness drew to a close, was

And the method adopted by S. Paul and Timothy‚ which

with its apostolical origin, and at the same time both
guaranteed the identity of the belief of each generation with
that of the preceding, and ensurad its continuity in the ·
future. Aa an illustration, we may take the notable case of
