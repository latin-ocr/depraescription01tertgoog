Introduction. 9

who were appointed by Apostles, and since such unbroken
chains formed the security for the faithful transmission ο1 the
true saith, for Tertullian to call upon the heretico to produce
their episcopal succession as the authority for their teaching.
Nor was it an unfair conclusion that the impossibility of their
complying with this demand proved the falsity and novelty
of their doctrines. The episcopal succession was in truth
a test of Catholicity, inasmuoh as it formed at once the link
with the past, the witness to continuity of lise, and the
guarantee of unity of 111111.

3. Agreeably with his line of argument in this 11111111,
Tertullian maintains that the Scriptores are not to bo made
the final court of appeal in discussions with the heretica
(oh. 15-19). The real question at issue begins higher up
as it were; and tho futility of an appeal to a literature whose
text was disputed and whose meaning was distorted was
obvious. Yet in other treatises (eg. odo. Marcion), when
discussing and refuting heresies on their merita, he does not
hesitate to argue from the Scriptores, deducing their truc
meaning from a comparison of passages, and rejecting one-
sided or heretical interpretations. This was the method
which had been adopted hy Irenaeus, and which was pur·
sued with signal success in later times by Athanasius and
Augustino.

'l'he need of some recognized authoritative interpretation
was clearly felt by all, and Tertullian urges that the Scrip-
turas are to be interpreted by the consentient testimony of
tho Apostolic churches, because 111 them the true traditional
exegesis will be found side hy side with the true text ο1 the
sacred writings (ch. 19). His remarks on the impropriety of
arguing from isolated texts in disregard of the context, or of
other passages of Scn‘pture, will bc recognized as alike sound
and acute (ch. 9).

The stylo of this treatise is far less vehement than that of
tho Apology, although instances are not wanting of Ter·
