Secutus est post haec et Saturninus, et hic similiter
dicens: innascibilem Virtutem, id est Deum, in summis et
illis infinitis partibus et in superioribus manere; longe5
autem distantes abhoc angelos inferiorem mundum fecisse:
et quia splendor quidam luminis desursum in inferioribus
refulsisset, 111 similitudinem illius luminis angelos hominem
instituere curasse3 hunc super terram iacuisse reptantem3

1. in nomine suo baptizatus. By this ‘baptism' which was
doubtless 10111 form of magioal incantation (111111 Mart. l. 0.), he
taught that 1 resurrection was 11111111 10 his disciples, 1111111111 they
would be preserved from death and from growing old; Iren. and
1111111.οσ. 1

3. Saturninus. A native 01 the Syr-ian Antioch, and possibly
a pupil 01 Menander; 1111 iii. 4, 3; Tert. 1111111111. 23. His name
is variously given 11 Σατορνῖνος (1111, Enoch), Σατορνεῖλος 01
Σατορνΐλος (Hippoi, Epiph.‚ Theodor.). His system is described by
heuneus (i. 18) 1111 by Hippolytus (Philon. vii. 16, 28), both accounts
being probably taken from J ustin Martyr’s ‘Syntagma' Comp. Enseb.
iv. 73 Philast. 31; Epiph Haer. ²3³ Theodor. Hace. fob. i. 3. Hs
postulated One Supreme Unknown, the Father of all, from Whom
issued 1 series of spiritual beings. Orestion was the work of seven
angele, who also made man, a 11111 creature unable to do more than
wriggle on the ground like 1 worm until raisedby the Supreme Power.
The same myth as to the 01111101 01 man is attributed below (chop. 3)
and in Iren. i. 28. 3 to the Ophites, in whose system however the seven
sons of Sophia-Prunikos replace the seven creator angele of Saturninus.
A close affinity 011 be traced throughout between the 11111111
Ophites and Saturninus, the latter no doubt having evolved the
original and simpler elementa 01 the system, Saturninus’ Christology
was Docetie‚ his rule of life Encratite.

4 innascibilem. Oehler quotes Iren. i. 18 ‘Salvatorem autem
innatum demonstravit'3 Theodor. l. o. τὸν n Σωτῆρα. . . ἀγγένητον
ἔφησε καὶ ἀσώματον καὶ derideor: but these phrases do not refer to the
hirst Principls. J unius (rightly I think) conjectured ‘innoscibilum‚’
quoting Iren. 10. ‘Saturninus . . . unum patrem incognitum omnibus
ostendit?

6. inferiorem. Rig. following conjecture ofF. Ursa: inferiores rel.

9. instituere curasse. The MSS. insert angelos between these
two words. t ’.
