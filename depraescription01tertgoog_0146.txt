Plin. H. N. iii. 1. 3 ‘iuridici conventus [Baeticae] quattuor, Gaditanus,
Cordubensis’ dte. It may be in this sense that J erome' phrase is to be
understood, de uir. illustr. 17, where he asserts that Polycarp's letter
was still read ‘in conventu Asiae'

¹ extincto paene lumine. Astronomicai calculatione fail to dis·
cover any sclipse about this time visible in Africa which would explain
this phenornenon; and Tertullian’s reference to the astronomers implies
that it baffled contemporary scientific opinion.

2. hypsomate=tcopan, ‘in its ascension,' or ‘altitude' ὕψωμα
and ταπείνωμα are converse astrological terme used of the ascension and
decleusion of stars; Sext. Empiric. v. 35. Tertullian's meaning is not
very clear; but by ‘suo hypsomate' he may mean the highest point of
the plane of the ecliptic above the plane of the moon's orbit; and in
such a position an eclipss of the sun would bs, as he says, impossible.
See however Petrus Possinus apud Migne P. L. iii 59.

signification of which in this connexion is obscure.

3. exitus. See note de praescr. haer. a. Lactantius in the fourth
century collected instances of the dooms of persecutore and embodied
them iu his treatise ‘De mortibus persecutorum’ (comp. Eusebi. 8).
In more recent times Spelman (‘ De non temerandis ecclesiis’) and
Wayland J oyce (‘Doom of Sacrilege') have attempted historical reviews
of a similar nature.

5. Vigellius Saturninus. Under this proconsul, who had been
‘legatus Augusti’ in Lower Moesia, and whose full name was Publius
VigelliusRaius Pierius Saturninus AtiliusBraduanusAncidiusTertullus,
Namphamo the ‘ archimartyr’ of Africa, with his companious Miggin,
Lucitas, and Samae, suffered martyrdom at Karthage on J uiy 4, 180 ;
Angustia. Epist. 15, 16. A fortnight later, J uly 17, the twelve Scillitau
martyra were putto death (for their names see D. aa. ii. 501 aa.
anrx 212). On Saturninus see a paper by Renier Rev. Arcleol. 1864,
