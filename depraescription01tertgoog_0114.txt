INTRODUCTION

Tffis inspiriting Address has been usually regarded as the
earliest of Tertullian's Christian writings, composed in the
year nu. 197, while the slaughter of Albinus' army near
Lyon (February 27), and the still more terrible massacre of
his partisaus in Rome by Severus' orders were fresh in the
minds of men ¹. But the reference on which this view of
the treatise is based is vague, and might be interpreted
equally well of the defection and punishment of the ad-
herents of Niger in the East some years later ². There is,
however, really no need to seek for the particular instances
of imperial vengeance which may have been in Tertullian's
mind. Any of the earlier years of Severus’ reign would
afford examples such as are alluded tc ; for punishment as
widely spread as thot which this Emperor inflicted could
certainly not have been completed in a single year ⁸.

The Address contains no traces of Montanium, although
imaginative commentators have found evidences ofa leaning
towards it in the simple allusion to the possibility of
jealousies and dissensione arising amongst the imprisoned
confessore ⁴. It is scarcely necessary to point out the
gratuitousness of reading such an idea into the passage;
while there are on the other hand positive reasons for
