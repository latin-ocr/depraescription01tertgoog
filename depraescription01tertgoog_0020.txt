session of the heretics, who can produce nc episcopal succes·
sions ; while on the other hand the unity and identity of the
belief preserved by the Apostohc churches in all parts
of the world guarantee its truth and genuineness. The
very laclr of episcopal succession from the Apostles—a laclr
which is itself both proof and consequence of later origin-
would he alone sufficient to refuto the pratensions of heresy,
without taking into account its divergcnce from the apostolic
creed (chap. 29). Heretics thus stand convicted, historically,
of recent origin-‘novitas’ ‘posteritas '—and, practically,
of innovation upon the faith-‘ fidem innovare’ (chap. 42)—
or deviation from the catholic standard of belief—‘labi
a regula' (chop. 3), ‘exorbitare’ (chap. 44). Such is the
general drift of the treatise3 but one or two of the points
raised in the course os the argument claim more attention.

1. The appeal to the unity of the (lhuroh’s doctrine as
a witness to its truth leads Tertullian to set forth the Oreed
cf the North African (lhurch. His methcd here follows that
of Irenaeus, and he points to the existence ofa fixed bcdy
of truth which is all-sufficient as a saving doctrine, and
beyond the bounds of which all is error. The form of the
‘Regula Fidei' given in chap. 13 (comp. ado. Pron. 2; de
airy. cel. Ι) is essentially the same with that preserved in
Irenaeus (i. 103 iii. 4; iv. 33 ¹), and with the early Roman
and Eastorn creeds ². Ι

It may be noticed in passing that the early fathers did not
lay that stress upon verhal identity which some commentatore
have demanded from them. Strong in the oonscioue pos-
session of the one Catholic Faith, they were content to set
out the facts of their belief in languagc which did indeed
often employ well-known and stereotyped phrases, but which
