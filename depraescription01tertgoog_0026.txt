heresies as helping to weed out from the Ohurch the unstable
and unfaithful members. And this service in days of open
persecution must hove been of no small velue.

'Phe whole tone and character of the work shew that its
author was an anlent Ohurchman. It is strange that any
one should have been found to maintoin that it was com-
posed after Tertullien had become a Montanist ¹. I have
drawn attention in the notes to several anti-Montanist pas-

sages, and it may be added that, in atreatise of the nature
'of the Dn Pnensomrmonu, the absence of any mention of the
New Prophecy would be inexplicohle if it were really a Mon·
tanistic work of our enthusiastic author.

The concluding words of the treatise imply that it was

written before the works against particular heresies, and in
some of them it is certainly referred to. The following
passages may bo noted :-

Dc earm obteri, 2 ‘Sed plenius eiusmodi praescrip-
tionibus adversus omnes haereses alibi iam usi sumus!

Adoneus Hermop. 1 ‘Solemus haereticis compendii gratia
de posteritate praescribere'

Arbiorum Marcion, i. 1 ‘Sed alius libellus hunc gradum
sustinebit adversus haereticos etiam sine retractatu doctrina-
rum revincendos quod hoc sint de praescriptione novitatis.
Nunc quatenus admittenda congressio est, interdum, ne
compendium praescriptionis ubique advocatum diffidentiae
deputetur, regulam adversarii prius praetexam, ne cui lateat
in qua principalis quaestio dimicatura cst!

It would hardly seem necessary to remark, had not an
opposite conclusion been forced from the passage ², that the
use of the future tense in this last citation (seminabit) is one
of the commoneat modes of speech by which a writer refers
his readers to further sources of information. It contains
no promise of a projected book as yet unwritten. Similar
