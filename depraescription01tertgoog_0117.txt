104 Ad Martyras.

preelude its date being fixed ns lete u ιω or ²05· 'she
euthalio tone ο( the Addrees might ot first eight seem to

Βειριὼ written in πυ is equally free from euy signe of

Whatever the views of the editor aad supplementer of ths
Visions my have hoen—„nd they dn not eppe-r tn have

An interesting example of Tertulliou'e coneentrution of
vision and immereion in the point before him is seen in hie
treatment of the mortyrs’ prison which he views undet five

over-development of uu idea is ohnrseteristic of our author,
oud in hie polemieul treutises sometimes leode him to indulge
in nuntiassem-y methods οἱ argument. But the ‘Ad
Mutym' is wholly devoted to braciug the aoursge of the
condemned confessore, und is charged with the breath ur
that sympathy md euenor-agemont which springs 0h1y smm
