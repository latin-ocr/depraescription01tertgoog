24 De praescriptione Haereticorum.

cmm Ghurch true doctrine is found along with true Scrip-

turas, for the Ohurch has no remon for interpolating
them. corruptions of the text are necessarily the work
of later hands, and ariae from hostility to the truth.
The cunning of Valentinus, who parrer-ted the meaning,
madeas grean havoc of the Scripturas as did the bold·
