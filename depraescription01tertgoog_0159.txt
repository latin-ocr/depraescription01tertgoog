146 Introduction.

Lipsius has succeeded in partly restoring it by a method
described in his work on Epiphanius cited in the footnote.
The contente of the Appendix agree remarkably with
Photius’ description of Hippolytus' little treatise. The
heresies enumerated are about thirty-two, beginning with
Dositheus and ending with Praxeas, whose Patripassianism
was identical with that of Noetus, and who perhaps occupied
a more prominent place in the translator's mind at the time ¹.
The absence of the names of heretica later than Praxeas
makes it probablc that the Appendix was subjoined to Ter·
tullian’s treatise sometime about the pontificate of Zephyrinus
(a n. 199-217) and at Rome, but by whom it is impossible
to determinet ’

¹ See' curatam Remcmbrbwcer J an. 1853, p. 239. Tertullian‘s own
work against Praxeas was largely indebted to Hippolytus‘ work against
Noetus3 Noedechen Tert. wider Praxeas in Jahrb. f. Prot Theoi
xiv. 576 (1888).

² Oehlar conjectured that the Appendix was the work of Victorinus
(rnartyred 303) of Patavium, ‘Adversus omnes Haereses,' mentioned by
J aroma dc vir. illustr. 74. This view has been criticized and rejected
by Dr. Caspai-i (Plummer‘s Dollinger's Hippolytus, p. 357).
