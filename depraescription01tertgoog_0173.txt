160 Pseudo· Tertulliani [cis. 1v.

qui cum Valentino per omnia consentiunt. In illc solo
differunt: nam cum Valentinus Aeonas tantum triginta
finxisset, isti addiderunt alios complures ; quatuor enim
primum, deinde alios quatuor adgregaverunt. Et quod dicit
5Valentinus Aeonem trigesimum excessisse de pleromate, ut
in desectionem, negant isti: nonenim ex illa triacontade
fuisse hunc, qui fuerit iu defectionem propter desiderium
videndi propatoris.
Exstitit praeterea Heracleon alter haereticus, quicum

πνευματικόν. All that is known of him is derived from Irenaeus
i. 1. 18, 6. 1, and an independent notice in Tertull. ada. Vol. 4.
Ocmp. Philast. 39, Epiph. Haer. 33. His characteristic tenet was
the independent personal subsistence, outside the Deity, cf the Aecus
of Valentinus. Some noticn of his teaching may be gathered from
the two fragments of his writing preserved in Iren. i. f. 18 (in
which he deduces teaching on the Ogdcad from the prologue ιο
S. J ohn's Gospel) and in Epiphan. ιο. (a letter cf Ptolemaeus ιο
Flora on the origin cf the Mosaic Law).

Secundus. Secundus is the first cf the Valentinian Gnostics
described by Irenaeus (i. 5. a), who is followed by Tertullian (adv.
Vol. 38), Hippolytus (vi. 38), and Epiphanius (Haer. 32): cp. Philast.
403 Augustiu. Haer. 12. He divided the Valentinian Ogdoad into
two Tetrade, a right and a left, calling the masculine Aeons Light,
and the feminine Darkness, thus approximating in terminolcgy more
closely than Valentinus to Oriental dualism.

3. isti addiderunt. This is a misunderstanding on the part of the
author. Neither Ptolemaeus nor Secundus, whom he here couples
together, made any addition tc the number of the Valentinian Aeone:
the peculiarity of Secundus' teaching lay in the grcuping cf thena

6. negant isti. This exclusion cf the Sophia, whose emotions
gave birth to the material world, from the Thirty Aeons, is ascribed ιο
Secundus, but not ιο Ptolemaeus, by the authorities cited above.

9. Heracleon. Heracleon was another pupil cf Valentinus3
Origen Coram. ia Iouna. ii. 8. His system was mors truly philosophical
than the Valentinian, betraying certain Pythagoream elementa, and
commencing with a Mcnad in place of Valentinus' Dusd. He
attempted ιο use its details in his interpretations, clten wildly
allegorica, oi the Gospels in his Ύπομνήματα cr ‘Commentarios’
(Orig. a. s. vi. 8). Fragments of these are embedded in Origen's
Commentarius cu S. Julian Olement of Alexandria's Stromoto iv.9
Ecloy. Propi. 25 ; and Photius Epire. 134· They have been edited,
