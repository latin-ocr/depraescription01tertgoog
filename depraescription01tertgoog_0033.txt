The word ‘heresy’ is derived from s Greek word meaning
‘choise' end refers to the seli—willed choico of a doctrine
in opposition ιο ι1ιο Rule hended down from Christ by
His Apostles.
VH. Heresies borrow their tenete from philosophy. Valentinus
is indebted ιο Plsto, Marcion ιο the Stolos, Lucanus

Christ will be found with us.
