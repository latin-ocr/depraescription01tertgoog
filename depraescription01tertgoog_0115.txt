102 Ad Martyres.

believing that the writer was not yet committed to the
extravagances of the Eastern heresy.¹

There is, for instance, no undue exaltation of martyrdom,
no fierce sanatioal joy at the confessors’ prospect ol death
Dei caussa3 they are encouraged only to hold themselves
still in the calm steadfast fortitude of patient enduring
faith in their Lord, and in the assurance of the abiding
presence of His Spirit. With this view of martydom it is
only necessary to contrast such Montanistic passages as
‘De Corona’ 1, and almost any page of the treatise ‘De
fuga in persecutione,' in order to see at once the wide
difference of tone which pervades this treatise.

Two other points also mark out this Address from the
Montanistic writings. (ι) The custom ol unrestored penitents
secking libelli from imprisoned confessore, by whose inter-
cession the lapsed were wont to be recommended to the
merciful consideration of the Church; and (a) the practice of
the Ohurch contributing food and money to her imprisoned
members‚ are both mentioned (chap. ι) in terms of approwal ;
whereas both customs are broadly denounoed in Montanistic
treatises-the former dc qmdicdia 22, and the latter dc
dicatis 12.

It seems strange that Tertullian‚ when exhorting the
confessore to courage by reminding them of past examples of
fortitude, should make no mention of the bravc witness unto
death borne by the earlier African sufferers-Namphamo,
and the Scillitan martyrs, nn. 180 ¹-and that all his
exemplos should be drawn from paganism. This, however,
may be intentional-‘tanti vitreum, quanti verum mar·
garituml'

Still stranger is it to observe the liberty which was
allowed to the Christiane to openly* visit and contribute to
the support cf their friends in prison. It is a curicus feature
which meets us constantly from the time of St. Paul down to
