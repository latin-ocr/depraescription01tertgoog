Synopsis. ⁶ 21

know, however, that Paul's Gospel was identical with
Peter’s and that there was a 'voluntary distribution of
office between them, that each should preach the same
Gcspel but ιο different persona-Peter to the Circum·
cision and Paul to the Gentiles. Paul’s rehuke was for
a fault in conduct, not in teaching.

XXIV. Yet the Apostles' conduct indeed was not necessarily the
same in all cases, but was adapted to particular cir·
cumstances.

(h) Nor did the special revelatione made ιο Paul render

and the authors of the tradition could not he in error.
XXIX. Error, no doubt, prevailed until the rise oi heresies! the
truth waited for the heretice ιο declaro it! But the
priority of the doctrine of the Ohurch is evidence of its
truth, for the counterleit cannot precede, but always
follows the genuine.
XXX. Marcion and Valentinus lived but a short time ago and
were apostates from the Ohurch. Apelles was a pupil
ol Marcion’s. And this late date of heresies is prooi of
